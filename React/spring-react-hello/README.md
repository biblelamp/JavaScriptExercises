# Spring  React  Hello World

This application shows how to 'wire' together the Spring Framework (Java based) with React.

At the moment is only a simple 'Hello World'. More documentation and features will follow.

## Run the example

The 'one command build' is still missing.
You have to start the server as normal Spring Boot application.:
- cd [main]/server
- mvn spring-boot:run

To run the client:
- cd [main]/client
- npm install
- npm start

Open: http://localhost:3000
